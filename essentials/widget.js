// To build any applications in Flutter, we start with widgets â€“ The building block of flutter applications. Widgets describe what their view should look like given their current configuration and state. It includes a text widget, row widget, column widget, container widget, and many more.

// Widgets: Each element on a screen of the Flutter app is a widget. The view of the screen completely depends upon the choice and sequence of the widgets used to build the apps. And the structure of the code of an apps is a tree of widgets

// It's like a component in React, but in Flutter, everything is a widget.

// For example there's a widget for a button, a widget for a text input, a widget for a row of items, a widget for a column of items, a widget for a container with a border, a widget for a container with rounded corners, a widget for a container with a shadow, and so on.

// On text widgets there are: style, textAlign, overflow, maxLines etc.
// On button widgets there are: color, eleveation, disabledColor, enabled etc.
